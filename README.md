Java Simulator for my oop course

Application uses the MVC model.

Application simulates a consumer electronics store in Finland (Gigantti),  in this simulator customer objects go through multiple service desks in a order.
When the customer is created it gets a randomized value for the product category what the customer is buying. This also determines the service desk route the customer takes.
For example a customer that buys a phone, doesn't need to wait in the warehouse line, unlike the customer buying a dishwasher.
